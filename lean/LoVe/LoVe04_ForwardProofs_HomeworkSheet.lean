/- ## Question 1: Logic Puzzles

Consider the following tactical proof: -/

theorem about_Impl :
    ∀a b : Prop, ¬ a ∨ b → a → b :=
  by
    intros a b hor ha
    apply Or.elim hor
    · intro hna
      apply False.elim
      apply hna
      exact ha
    · intro hb
      exact hb

/- 1.1. Prove the same theorem again, this time by providing a proof term.

Hint: There is an easy way. -/

theorem about_Impl_term :
    ∀a b : Prop, ¬ a ∨ b → a → b :=
  sorry

/- 1.2. Prove the same theorem again, this time by providing a
structured proof, with `fix`, `assume`, and `show`. -/

theorem about_Impl_struct :
    ∀a b : Prop, ¬ a ∨ b → a → b :=
  sorry


/- ## Question 2: More Logic Puzzles

Recall the following tactical proof: -/

theorem weak_peirce :
    ∀a b : Prop, ((((a → b) → a) → a) → b) → b :=
  by
    intro a b habaab
    apply habaab
    intro habaa
    apply habaa
    intro ha
    apply habaab
    intro haba
    apply ha

/- 2.1. Prove the same theorem again, this time by providing a proof
term.

Hint: There is an easy way. -/

theorem weak_peirce_term :
    ∀a b : Prop, ((((a → b) → a) → a) → b) → b :=
  sorry

/- 2.2. Prove the same theorem again, this time by providing a structured
proof, with `fix`, `assume`, and `show`. -/

theorem weak_peirce_struct :
    ∀a b : Prop, ((((a → b) → a) → a) → b) → b :=
  sorry


/- ## Question 3: Connectives and Quantifiers

3.1. Supply a structured proof of the commutativity of `∧` under an `∃`
quantifier, using no other theorems than the introduction and elimination rules
for `∃`, `∧`, and `↔`. -/

theorem And_comm_under_Exists {α : Type} (p q : α → Prop) :
    (∃x, p x ∧ q x) ↔ (∃x, q x ∧ p x) :=
  sorry

/- 3.2. Supply a structured proof of the commutativity of `∨` under a `∀`
quantifier, using no other theorems than the introduction and elimination rules
for `∀`, `∨`, and `↔`. -/

theorem Or_comm_under_All {α : Type} (p q : α → Prop) :
    (∀x, p x ∨ q x) ↔ (∀x, q x ∨ p x) :=
  sorry

/- 3.3. We have proved or stated three of the six possible implications between
`ExcludedMiddle`, `Peirce`, and `DoubleNegation` in the exercise of lecture 3.
Prove the three missing implications using structured proofs, exploiting the
three theorems we already have. -/
